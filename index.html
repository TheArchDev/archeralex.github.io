<h2>
<a id="introduction" class="anchor" href="introduction" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Introduction</h2>

<p>Thanks for visiting my website! I've started putting these pages together to serve as the main interface for others to see a summary of the different software/code-related projects I've been working on.</p>
<p>My motivation for putting this page together stems from wanting to:
  <ul>
    <li>  Provide a more visual entry point and navigation means around my GitHub portfolio</li>
    <li>  Consolidate my own thoughts and put some more commentary on certain aspects</li>
    <li>  Simply experiment with a new technical product/feature, namely the versatile and convenient User Page functionality offered by GitHub!</li>
  </ul>

<p>I'm still very much in the midst of getting more code samples uploaded to my GitHub repositories and showcasing them here - I therefore expect things to change here over time. I also intend to include some topics which may not be considered actual 'code' samples but which I nonetheless find interesting for other reasons. Most of the sections listed below should have a corresponding GitHub Project Page which I've set up, or at least a GitHub repository where I've got some raw content.</p>

<h3>
<a id="gocode-portfolio" class="anchor" href="gocode-portfolio" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>GoCode Portfolio</h3>

<p>I took part in a 2-month intensive software development course from January until March 2016 to improve my development skills.</p>
<div style='border:solid black 2px; border-radius: 10px; padding:10px'>
<p>The main focuses were programming in <b>Python</b> and full-stack web development through the <b>Django</b> web framework. Other technologies/techniques covered included:
<ul>
  <li>Git/GitHub</li>
  <li>SQL</li>
  <li>JavaScript</li>
  <li>jQuery</li>
  <li>Heroku</li>
  <li>Amazon S3</li>
  <li>HTML/CSS</li>
  <li>Bootstrap</li>
  <li>JSON APIs</li>
  <li>AJAX calls</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>Please go ahead to my <a href="http://archeralex.github.io/gocode_portfolio/"> GoCode Portfolio</a> to have a look at some of the projects I worked on whilst there.</p>

<h3>
<a id="geoquiz" class="anchor" href="geoquiz" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Geoquiz</h3>

<p>This is a Django project I started during the GoCode course and which I am still looking to make multiple improvements to over time. More than anything, it served as great practice in building both the back and front end of a Django app from the bottom-up before seeing it  go 'live' via Heroku. Head here to see my <a href="http://archeralex.github.io/geoquiz/">Geoquiz GitHub Page</a> or you can head directly to the <a href="https://young-brushlands-36442.herokuapp.com/">Geoquiz Heroku</a> page, where I have hosted the whole website.</p>

<h3>
<a id="project-euler" class="anchor" href="project-euler" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Project Euler</h3>

<p>I have recently tried out some more mathematically-orientated problems which ultimately rely on some degree of programming in order to be successfully solved - I have a <a href="https://github.com/archeralex/project_e">GitHub repo</a> where I plan to track some example problems and my attempted solutions.</p>

<h3>
<a id="manufactoria" class="anchor" href="manufactoria" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Manufactoria</h3>

<p>This is a simple yet incredibly addictive game and one I've really enjoyed trying out.
  In summary, the player must successfully design an algorithm to process incoming string patterns in order to accept or reject certain features. Each level has different criteria that must be met for the incoming strings and at later levels more comparisons are made to 0 or 1 computer bits.
  The easiest way to understand it is to simply try it out yourself <a href="http://pleasingfungus.com/Manufactoria/">here</a>!. I still have some levels on my hitlist to solve, but here's a link to my <a href="http://archeralex.github.io/manufactoria/">GitHub repo</a> with my working solutions so far.</p>
