<a id="gocode-portfolio" class="anchor" href="gocode-portfolio" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>GoCode Portfolio</h3>

<p>I took part in a 2-month intensive software development to improve my development skills from January until March 2016. Please go ahead to my <a href="http://archeralex.github.io/gocode_portfolio/"> GoCode Portfolio</a> to have a look at some of the projects I worked on whilst there.</p>

<h3>
<a id="geoquiz" class="anchor" href="geoquiz" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Geoquiz</h3>

<p>This is a Django project I started during the GoCode course and which I am still making improvements on. Head here to see my <a href="http://archeralex.github.io/geoquiz/">Geoquiz GitHub Page</a> or you can head directly to the <a href="https://young-brushlands-36442.herokuapp.com/">Geoquiz Heroku</a> page, where I have hosted the whole website.</p>

<h3>
<a id="project-euler" class="anchor" href="project-euler" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Project Euler</h3>

<p>I have tried out some more mathematically-orientated problems which ultimately rely on some degree of programming in order to be successfully solved - have a look at my <a href="https://github.com/archeralex/project_e">GitHub repo</a> here to see some example problems and my attempted solutions.</p>

<h3>
<a id="manufactoria" class="anchor" href="manufactoria" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Manufactoria</h3>

<p>This is a simple yet incredibly addictive game and one I've really enjoyed trying out. It ultimately comes down to 0 or 1 computer and getting the desired output for various inputs - the easiest way to understand it is to try it out yourself <a href="http://pleasingfungus.com/Manufactoria/">here</a>. I still have some levels on my hitlist to solve, but here's a link to my <a href="">GitHub repo</a> with my working solutions so far.</p>
